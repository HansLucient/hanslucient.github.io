      <h2>Korean</h2>
      <h2>The Importance of Religious Services</h2>
      <p>Almost half the population of Korea has no religious affiliation. In fact, just 3 in 10 have any ties to Christianity, with the majority in the Protestant sphere. Because only about 30 percent of Koreans are Christian, attendance of church is not always a part of Christmas. In fact, Jesus may have no place in many homes that celebrate the date. However, for those Koreans who are religious, family attendance of both Christmas eve and Christmas day is mandatory.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sixty-one percent of Korean Americans who state they are Christian are Protestant and approximately 10 percent are Catholic.</li>
          <li>Eighteen percent of South Korean Christians are Protestant and 11 percent are Catholic.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>These will be the religious services South Koreans attend if they have Christian faith.
Christmas is a public holiday and Koreans celebrate on December 25 just like everywhere else. Work is suspended by law and most people have a day off. Revelers will give a Korean greeting of Sung Tang Chuk Ha, or Merry Christmas. Christmas for Koreans, wherever they are, is often about family and echoes many Western traditions; however, Christmas is also a day for young people to go out and party together or have a special date.</p>
      <h2>Christmas Cards</h2>
      <p>Korean Christmas cards are an important way to keep in contact with family and friends for both indigenous and transplant populations. Writing during the holiday season to family in Korea, helps Korean Americans stay in touch and feel part of the family celebration. However, more general holiday greetings might be used in lieu of Merry Christmas.</p>
      <h2>Christmas Movies</h2>
      <p>Christmas movies, most of which are Westernized, are popular in Korea. The few that do not come with subtitles provide fun for the family or provide a moving holiday story. A couple examples of holiday movies to watch include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Based on a popular children's cartoon, the movie Mug Travel follows the tale of a small child on Christmas Eve and her adventures with animal friends.</li>
          <li>Merry Christmas Mr. Mo follows a terminally ill man who wants to give gifts at Christmas to family and friends.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Exchanging Gifts</h2>
      <p>Gift giving isn't as rampant in Korea as it is in the United States. In fact, in most families each person only gets one gift. Often it is given after a musical performance or poetry recital which has entertained the group. Gifts are always given with both hands. Koreans often give brand name items, liquor (unless religious), and items to meet year end needs. It is common to give children cash toward the end of the year.</p>
      <h2>Decorated Trees and Homes</h2>
      <p>Even families who are not religious love a Christmas tree even though it is likely artificial. Decorations are similar to Western decor with twinkling lights and ornaments but may add special items like silk slippers or traditional drums. However, there are fewer outdoor decorations for homes because of the multi-family apartment and condo living units that are found in South Korea.</p>
